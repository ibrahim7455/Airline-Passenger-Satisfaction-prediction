# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-prediction
## Project Overview
This project, developed as part of the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI), aims to analyze and predict airline passenger satisfaction using data science techniques. By leveraging a dataset of passenger feedback, the project explores various factors that impact satisfaction levels, such as service quality, flight experience, and demographics. The goal is to provide actionable insights to improve the overall customer experience for airlines.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information on various aspects of passenger experience, including:

Passenger Demographics: Gender, Age, Customer Type (Loyal/Disloyal)
Travel Information: Class, Type of Travel (Personal/Business), Flight Distance
Satisfaction Metrics: Ratings for inflight services, online booking, seat comfort, inflight entertainment, cleanliness, and more
Delay Information: Departure and arrival delays in minutes
Overall Satisfaction: Categorized as Satisfied, Neutral, or Dissatisfied
## Analysis Process
The project follows a comprehensive approach to analyze the data:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Source: Dataset sourced from Kaggle.
Data Cleaning: Removal of duplicate or incomplete entries, correction of inconsistencies, and handling of missing values.
Data Transformation: Scaling and encoding features to optimize model performance.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics: Summary measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation to understand data distribution.
Data Visualization: Visuals created using Power BI, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to identify patterns, trends, and correlations.
Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between variables affecting passenger satisfaction.
3. Feature Engineering and Selection
Deriving New Features: Creation of new variables from existing features.
Transforming Features: Scaling and encoding key variables.
Selecting Relevant Features: Identifying factors that are most influential in predicting satisfaction.
4. Model Building and Evaluation
Supervised Learning Techniques: Utilized various machine learning models including KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM.
Model Training and Evaluation: Training models using labeled data and evaluating performance with metrics such as accuracy and precision.
5. Visualization and Insights with Power BI
Enhanced data analysis and visualization using Power BI to create interactive dashboards and reports.
## Key Libraries Used
NumPy: Efficient numerical computing and data manipulation
Pandas: Data analysis and manipulation.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning model implementation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization and exploratory analysis.
Power BI: Interactive dashboards and advanced visual reporting.
## Project Outcome
The project successfully identifies key factors influencing passenger satisfaction and builds predictive models to classify satisfaction levels as "Satisfied," "Neutral," or "Dissatisfied." The use of Power BI enhances data presentation, allowing stakeholders to gain valuable insights quickly and effectively.

## Conclusion
Understanding what drives passenger satisfaction helps airlines improve their services and retain customers. By combining data analysis, machine learning, and interactive reporting tools like Power BI, this project delivers actionable insights for enhancing passenger experiences.
